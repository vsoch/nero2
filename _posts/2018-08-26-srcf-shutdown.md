A shutdown of the Stanford Research Computing Facility (SRCF) is planned for Labor Day weekend, Saturday through Monday, September 1-3, due to the need for power system maintenance.


## Nero will not be available for login, to submit jobs or to access files.

We will bring Nero down on Friday, August 31 at noon.  If everything goes according to plan, access will be restored on Tuesday, Sep. 4 at 9am.

During that time, jobs will not run, file systems will not be available, and login nodes will be offline. All network connectivity to Nero will be interrupted.

We know that this is a disruptive event, but power maintenance is a necessary operation, and all servers and equipment at the SRCF will need to be shut down, including the generators, when the power goes off. The Labor Day weekend was chosen for this event because it has consistently lower power use, implying lowest load at the SRCF.

Please see the [SRCF reboot page][url_srcf_shutdown] for additional details, and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any question.
